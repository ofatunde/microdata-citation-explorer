# Semantic search

We made use of the Semantic Scholar API.

From the Semantic Scholar API, we get the datasets labeled **“query_typex_abs,”** where the x  in the name = 1,2,3,4,5,6 refers to the query type. These datasets contain the following variables: **paper title, abstract, corpus ID (also called paper ID), author IDs, Digital Object identifiers (DOIs), publication year,** the **journal**  where the paper was published, and the **dataset ID**. These metadata datasets will be merged with the metadata datasets we get from the NLP4DEV API website.

## Citations

The following papers informed our approach: {cite}`Fast2016`,{cite}`Chen2006`.
