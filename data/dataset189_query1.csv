0,195504488,189,Dignity and displaced Syrians in Lebanon. ‘There is no karama here’,"Since the popular uprising and subsequent war in Syria in 2011, more than a quarter of its population have fled – mainly to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt – and another 25% have been internally displaced. The end of 2017 saw 12.6 million Syrians forcibly displaced – 6.3 million refugees, 6.2 million internally displaced (IDPs) and 146,700 asylum-seekers. In the words of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi: ‘A quarter of all Syrians are refugees. A quarter of the world’s refugees are Syrians’.In Lebanon, 976,065 Syrians were registered as refugees with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as of 31 June 2018, out of an estimated 1.5 million Syrians residing there – most of whom (87%) live in Lebanon’s 251 most vulnerable and deprived municipalities. Lebanon hosts the largest proportion of refugees compared to its population worldwide, with one in six under the UNHCR mandate – virtually all of whom are Syrian (UNHCR, 2018a). In 2017, more than three-quarters of Syrian refugee households in Lebanon lived below the poverty line ($3.84/person/day), making humanitarian aid essential for many. Yet as the needs of Syrians rise, international funding continues to fall. In 2017, the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP) was only 45% funded, and only 17% of the displaced Syrian population received multi-purpose cash assistance from UNHCR, though nearly 70% of those registered are eligible.This case study is part of a two-year project by the Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG) at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) seeking to better understand dignity in displacement. Central to humanitarian principles and foundational human rights documents, dignity is often invoked in modern humanitarian action, yet aid programmes and policies rarely identify exactly what it is, or how they are trying to support it. More importantly, they seldom gather or report affected communities’ views on dignity. This research seeks to fill this gap.

1,211116634,189,Resettled Syrian Refugees in Oxford,"This policy brief presents preliminary findings on how Syrian refugees who came to Oxfordshire via the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme (SVPRS) have been adapting to their new life in the United Kingdom. According to the latest statistics of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the number of refugees fleeing from Syria has reached 6.3 million, constituting the largest refugee population in the world. In response to the large outflow of Syrian refugees, the UK government launched the SVPRS in 2015, announcing plans to resettle up to 20,000 Syrian refugees in the UK by May 2020. Following this announcement in 2015, Oxford City Council passed a proposal to accept 10 Syrian refugee families. This decision was reviewed in 2016 and again in 2017, with a decision being made to take a further 10 families each year. At the time of this study, a total of 28 families have been received in Oxford via SVPRS. After fleeing the civil war in Syria, most of these families had sought refuge in neighbouring countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq, and experienced many difficulties in the years before they were resettled in the UK. Given that a few years have passed since the arrival of the first families in Oxford, this study aims to understand the integration processes that these Syrian families have followed, while highlighting policy implications for local authorities and refugee-supporting agencies. Oxford City Council secures accommodation for the refugee families and commissions support services. Once SVPRS families are received in Oxford, contracted NGOs (Asylum Welcome and Connection Support) assist the newly arrived Syrians. These aid agencies provide guidance on daily life in Oxford and help to facilitate their ‘settling in’ processes. In addition, they are responsible for helping newly arrived refugees meet their basic needs, facilitating access to medical and educational services, enrolling in English lessons, and searching for employment. The ultimate objective of these agencies is to enable Syrian families to be ‘integrated’ into Oxford, which is often discussed in terms of achieving ‘independence’ or ‘self-reliance’. This means that they do not have to rely on commissioned support providers but can either manage independently or have the knowledge and skills to be able to access the support they need such as welfare rights advice. At the time of this study, most of the families had been in Oxford for 1-2 years, and had navigated considerable challenges in adjusting to a completely new living environment, even as they found opportunities in their new country of residence. The research entailed semi-structured interviews with 14 families out of the 28 families currently in Oxford, and also interviews with staff members from Oxford City Council, community-based groups, and refugee-assisting NGOs between January and July 2018. For privacy reasons, the names of all refugee interviewees are pseudonyms. RSC Research in Brief 9, September 2018",[],10.1163/2210-7975_hrd-3181-20180005,2018,
2,188442469,189,"Educate, Empower, Employ","Since the start of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, Lebanon is estimated to have taken in more than two million Syrian refugees. Due to policy and security obstacles, many of these refugees are considered by the Lebanese government to be living in Lebanon illegally, which restricts, among other aspects, their ability to continue employment or education. Based on field research conducted in-country through interviews, surveys, and focus groups, the authors have identified areas where innovative and inclusive higher education opportunities can be provided for Syrian refugees in Lebanon to allow them to move forward with their lives in self-sufficiency and dignity. The research aimed to answer the following questions: ● Where are the intersections of the interests and expectations of Syrian refugees in Lebanon with higher education and employment opportunities? ● How do individual characteristics such as gender, age, time in exile, and class affect refugees’ perceptions of their higher education needs and ambitions? ● What are the current barriers to accessing higher education, and what is the necessary support needed to overcome the barriers? ● Where are the opportunities for universities to fill the gaps in programming or resources? I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, it is estimated that Lebanon has taken in more than two million Syrian refugees--this into a country with a population of four million Lebanese citizens and 500,000 Palestinian refugees who have lived in the country for decades. Syrian refugees in Lebanon face many challenges, some of the most difficult being: ● In 2015, the Lebanese government stopped allowing the UNHCR to register Syrians entering the country as refugees. Since then, any new arrivals have been consequently unable to access protection or benefits. Given the long and complicated history between the two countries, and the influx of Palestinian refugees who remain in Lebanon decades later, the Lebanese government is making it difficult for Syrians to stay in the country. ● Syrians in Lebanon must obtain residency papers and renew them every six months through an arduous and expensive process. This has resulted in many refugees living, as considered by the The Journal of International Relations, Peace and Development Studies A publication by Arcadia University and the American Graduate School in Paris 101, boulevard Raspail, 75006 Paris – France Tel: +33(0)1 47 20 00 94 – Fax: +33 (0)1 47 20 81 89 Website: www.ags.edu (Please cite this paper as the following: Danielle L.

Supporting this population in their host countries is more crucial than ever, particularly with scholarships and access to education in many countries presently restricted. This complex emergency has stripped Syrian refugees of access to education and employment. Through our research, we sought to provide recommendations for higher education institutions to develop programs that could lead to economic opportunity for this vulnerable population. With that in mind, the following questions informed our research and recommendations for program design: 1. Where are the intersections of the interests and expectations of Syrian refugees in Lebanon with higher education and employment opportunities? 2. How do individual characteristics such as gender, age, time in exile, and class affect refugees’ perceptions of their higher education needs and ambitions? 3. What are the current barriers refugees face in accessing higher education, and what is the necessary support needed to overcome those barriers? 4. Where are the opportunities for universities, both domestic and international, to fill the gaps in programming or resources? In order to conduct a thorough assessment and answer these research questions, we conducted a systematic literature review and field research. We held interviews with 42 stakeholders, six focus groups with a total of 54 Syrian participants, and deployed a mobile survey taken by 784 Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The information and data collected was disaggregated by gender, age, class, and time in exile, and provided us with insight into the extraordinary circumstances faced by this population. It was apparent that designing a program that addresses their unique needs requires creative thinking, innovative solutions, and adequate support. This report details the conclusions from our research.","[{'authorId': '71465164', 'name': 'Daniel Bernard'}, {'authorId': '2066361000', 'name': 'MaryBeth Bognar'}, {'authorId': '147084177', 'name': 'Jami Hunter'}]",,2018,Journal of International Relations
3,203291058,189,From security to resilience: New vistas for international responses to protracted crises.,"International institutions and organizations like the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU), governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have started to embrace the notion of ‘resilience’ as a way of thinking to guide international responses to international security – in particular with regards to governing protracted crises. Protracted crises are “fragile contexts characterized by long-term political instability, (episodes of) violent conflict, and vulnerability of the lives and livelihoods of the population” (Macrae & Harmer, 2004, p. 15) – like those across central and east Africa, and the Middle East. The concept of resilience is not new to crisis governance. International frameworks for responding to natural disasters, such as the Hyogo Framework for Action (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk [UNISDR], 2005) and the follow-up Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR, 2015), have long placed the idea of resilience central. With regards to insecurity due to political violence and armed conflict however, the concept is relatively new (Bourbeau, 2013; 2015; Brasset & Vaughan-Williams, 2015; see also Anderson & Wallace, 2013). Nevertheless, it features prominently across a range of policies, including for example the European Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy (Wagner & Anholt, 2016), the EU’s Action Plan for Resilience in Crisis Prone Countries (European Commission [EC], 2013), or programmes such as the Regional Refugee & Resilience Plan (3RP), a consortium co-led by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP), with the participation of the governments of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt, and some 270 partners, including UN agencies and international and local NGOs (Gonzalez, 2016; 3RP, 2018).","[{'authorId': '83370432', 'name': 'R.

4,211103442,189,MENA PS RESEARCH PROJECT PROTECTION IMPACTS OF CASH-BASED INTERVENTIONS WITH A FOCUS ON CHILD PROTECTION,"UNHCR has been promoting research projects aimed at assessing the contribution of different cash assistance modalities for enhancing child protection outcomes and improving the well-being of refugee children and their households. UNHCR cash assistance programs in the MENA region are some of the largest and most advanced cash programs in the world. UNHCR distributed over US$ 230 million in cash assistance across the region in 2018, reaching some one million individuals. CBI represent an important component of a much broader and integrated network of activities and services provided by UNHCR to provide protection and assistance to the most vulnerable. Existing vulnerability assessment tools such as the Vulnerability Assessment Framework in Jordan (VAF), Vulnerability Assessment for Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) and Egypt Vulnerability Assessment of Refugees (EVAR) used for identification of vulnerability focus mainly on socioeconomic factors, with limited weight given to specific protection needs such as child protection or prevention, risk mitigation and response to sexual and gender based violence (SGBV). Separate pathways for CP and SGBV referrals have been developed to address the need to include families provided with child protection case management services among beneficiaries of cash assistance programmes. The region has a critical mass of data that can be analysed to better understand the impact of cash transfers on mitigating protection risks among children.",[],,2020,
5,254071595,189,Using Facebook advertising data to describe the socio-economic situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon,"While the fighting in the Syrian civil war has mostly stopped, an estimated 5.6 million Syrians remain living in neighboring countries1. Of these, an estimated 1.5 million are sheltering in Lebanon. Ongoing efforts by organizations such as UNHCR to support the refugee population are often ineffective in reaching those most in need. According to UNHCR's 2019 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees Report (VASyR), only 44% of the Syrian refugee families eligible for multipurpose cash assistance were provided with help, as the others were not captured in the data. In this project, we are investigating the use of non-traditional data, derived from Facebook advertising data, for population level vulnerability assessment. In a nutshell, Facebook provides advertisers with an estimate of how many of its users match certain targeting criteria, e.g., how many Facebook users currently living in Beirut are “living abroad,” aged 18–34, speak Arabic, and primarily use an iOS device. We evaluate the use of such audience estimates to describe the spatial variation in the socioeconomic situation of Syrian refugees across Lebanon. Using data from VASyR as ground truth, we find that iOS device usage explains 90% of the out-of-sample variance in poverty across the Lebanese governorates. However, evaluating predictions at a smaller spatial resolution also indicate limits related to sparsity, as Facebook, for privacy reasons, does not provide audience estimates for fewer than 1,000 users. Furthermore, comparing the population distribution by age and gender of Facebook users with that of the Syrian refugees from VASyR suggests an under-representation of Syrian women on the social media platform. This work adds to growing body of literature demonstrating the value of anonymous and aggregate Facebook advertising data for analysing large-scale humanitarian crises and migration events.","[{'authorId': '72339731', 'name': 'M.

 By focusing on Sudanese refugees and asylum-seekers in Lebanon, who in 2018 constituted 4 per cent of all persons of concern to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in that country, this article explores how the UNHCR protects and assists refugees not encompassed by the mainstream humanitarian response. The article finds that in terms of refugee recognition, resettlement, and overall protection, Sudanese refugees receive differential treatment when compared with the more dominant refugee groups. More precisely, it argues that the humanitarian practices contribute to structural processes of invisibilisation of the particularities of the protection concerns and circumstances of Sudanese refugees. It spotlights how, while racism and racial discrimination remain major protection concerns for the Sudanese community in Lebanon, humanitarian vulnerability assessments are altogether blind to these categories of harm. In examining how Sudanese refugees respond to and resist such processes of invisibilisation, the article also examines two key collective action approaches through which Sudanese refugees seek to access better protection and assistance: the establishment of representative refugee committees, on the one hand, and refugee protest, on the other. It finds that refugee protest was an important means of countering humanitarian processes of invisibilisation.","[{'authorId': '74726527', 'name': 'Maja Janmyr'}]",10.1093/rsq/hdab012,2021,Refugee Survey Quarterly

Syria’s neighborhood hosts currently about 5.5 million forcibly displaced Syrians who have fled the crisis since its onset in 2011. More than 3.4 million Syrians are registered in Turkey and around 2 million in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt (World Bank 2016). According to the UNHCR (2017), the small Lebanese state hosts today around 1.5 million registered Syrians, making it the country with the highest number of refugees per capita (Yasmin 2022). How has Lebanon’s political system dealt with the Syrian refugee issue and how have Syrian refugees – a new “non-core group”(Harris 2012) in Lebanon’s society – interacted with the state’s confessional configuration of power? How has Lebanon’s political system framed and accommodated an external “minority” in the context of a refugee-producing conflict and how has the political discourse constructed the issue of large-scale displacement?
The conflict in Syria between the government of Bashar al-Assad and various other forces, which started in the spring of 2011, continues to cause displacement within the country and across the region. At the end of 2018, Syrians continued to be the largest forcibly displaced population, with 13.0 million people living in displacement, including 6,654,000 refugees, 6,184,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and 140,000 asylum seekers (Ferris, Kiris ci, Shaikh 2013; UN OCHA 2016).","[{'authorId': '9899978', 'name': 'L.

9,148645104,189,No Country of Asylum: ‘Legitimizing’ Lebanon’s Rejection of the 1951 Refugee Convention,"How do States ‘legitimize’ their non-ratification of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees? This article examines the case of Lebanon, a country frequently hailed by the international community for its generosity towards refugees, and currently hosting the highest number of refugees in the world in proportion to its population size. While Lebanon engaged actively in the establishment of the international refugee regime, it has long insisted that it is not a country of asylum and steadfastly rejects ratification of the major refugee law instruments. Based on 10 months of field research, this article makes four arguments as to why Lebanon continues to resist ratification of the 1951 Refugee Convention and its Protocol. First, it argues that there is a widespread and real, or simply politically expedient, uncertainty as to the obligations that come with the Convention. This includes a belief that the Convention requires that Lebanon allow for the permanent settlement of refugees on its territory. Secondly, it argues that the responsibility-shift for refugees to third parties such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees brings about obvious advantages for Lebanon, and has made it less inclined to become a party to the Convention. Thirdly, it argues that the ‘good-neighbourliness’ principle between Arab countries holds that Lebanon should not employ the term ‘refugee’ because doing so would put the State into positions that could violate the good neighbour principle; essentially, ratifying the Convention would entail a duty to recognize certain forced migrants as refugees. Finally, the article argues that many Lebanese government officials and policymakers consider Lebanon’s accession to the Convention redundant for three key reasons. First, Lebanon applies the provisions of the Convention and Protocol on a voluntary basis, so that there is no need for ratification; secondly, Lebanon already has human rights obligations towards refugees on its territory by virtue of its membership of the United Nations and its * Faculty of Law, University of Bergen, Norway; email: Maja.Janmyr@uib.no.

Library of Medicine and Health Sciences user on 19 March 2018 ratification of a number of core human rights instruments; and, thirdly, due to the ‘crisis’ in international refugee law, in which many States appear to reject the Convention altogether, Lebanese decision makers are now questioning the relevance of these instruments. 1 . I N T R O D U C T I O N The 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (the 1951 Refugee Convention) are the two primary international legal instruments that provide for the protection of the world’s refugees. However, in the Middle East, few States have acceded to these instruments, and no regional refugee regime such as those found in Africa or Latin America exists.1 This is seemingly paradoxical for a region in which forced migration has long been a standard element of life, and where refugees may even be seen as a ‘defining feature’.2 In the literature, significant work has been done to explain Middle Eastern States’ non-commitment to international refugee law.3 However, few studies have explored the particular circumstances of any one of these States.4 It is arguable that the reasons for non-accession to the Convention vary between States, and, although some explanations may be valid throughout the region, important nuances may be lost by viewing these States as a group. This article intends to address this gap in the literature by providing an examination of the key arguments used by one of these States – Lebanon – to ‘legitimize’ its rejection of the 1951 Refugee Convention. Unlike many other States in the region, Lebanon engaged actively in the establishment of the international refugee regime. In addition, while many refugee populations in Lebanon have historically been marginalized and mistreated,5 the international community has often lauded the country’s approach to refugees. In 2014, for example, the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General stated that, ‘Lebanon is a key pillar in the international framework for the protection of Syrian refugees, and without it, that entire system would collapse’.6 Indeed, a strong national myth in Lebanon identifies it as the cradle of international human rights, and the country, with its perceived geography, 1 Although attempts were made in 1992 with the drafting of the Declaration of Refugees and Displaced Persons in the Arab World.

This approach can be traced back to the Lebanese Constitution of 1926 (as amended in 1990), which appears to prohibit any permanent settlement of foreigners. It is also cemented in the key document laying out the UN and government response to the country’s Syrian refugee presence, the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP), which states that: ‘Lebanon is neither a country of asylum, nor a final destination for refugees, let alone a country of resettlement’.11 The unwillingness to host refugees is furthermore reflected in the lack of formal domestic refugee legislation. Asylum issues are instead attended to through immigration laws. The 1962 Law Regulating the Entry and Stay of Foreigners in Lebanon and their Exit from the Country12 contains six articles relating to asylum. The asylum provisions in the 1962 Law on Entry and Exit have only been applied once since the end of 7 See generally I Salamey, The Government and Politics of Lebanon (Routledge 2014); W Harris, The New Face of Lebanon: History’s Revenge (Markus Wiener Publishers 2006). 8 CIA, The World Factbook  accessed 24 October 2016.

Naturally, neighboring countries are the ones primarily affected by these movements, as people leave their homes in search of safety elsewhere. In recent history, millions of people escaping from the confl icts in Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan, Iraq, Congo, and Syria have crossed their borders and moved into neighboring countries. The most recent example of this has been the Syrian civil war, which generated a massive infl ux of refugees who are currently residing in fi ve nearby countries; as of late 2019, they number as follows: 3.7 million in Turkey, 924,000 in Lebanon, 657,000 in Jordan, 228,000 in Iraq, and 130,000 in Egypt, adding up to a total of more than 5.6 million Syrian refugees residing in the Middle East and North Africa (UNHCR 2019b). In addition to these huge numbers, there is also a sizable number of Syrian refugees who are settled in other countries beyond the Middle East as a spillover effect of the mass displacement in the region. For instance, the number of Syrians arriving in the twenty-eight me mber states of the European Union (EU) seeking international protection reached nearly one million as of 2018 (EUROSTAT 2018).","[{'authorId': '11746336', 'name': 'A.

Some Syrian women in Egypt have drawn the attention of media, religious leaders, and advocacy groups by marrying Egyptian men soon after arriving (Hassan 2015; Geha 2013). Social media campaigns such as Laajiat Lasabaya (Lājiʾāt la Sabāyā)2 or “Refugees, not spoils of war” (also rendered on their Facebook page as: Refugees...Not Spoils) were ignited as a reaction to this practice in Egypt, as well as Lebanon, Jordan and other Arab countries where such marriages have been facilitated, encouraged and organized through different channels such as marriage brokers, social media and religious organizations (Barkan 2012). This paper is part of a broader study that I conducted for my fieldwork in Egypt during the summer of 2017 where I interviewed thirty-three Syrian refugee women who escaped the conflict in Syria and married Egyptian men post 2011 once they settled in Egypt. It highlights a recurring notion that I came across during many of the interviews—Zawāj al-Sutra (Protection or Shelter Marriage). In such cases, the man is motivated to marry a widow, especially that of another man who died because of war, with the intention of providing her and her children with livelihood and emotional support.

14,229389406,189,"Sýrlenskir nemendur í íslenskum grunnskólum: Upplifun nemenda, foreldra og kennara","In 2016 Iceland, in cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), received a group of Syrian quota refugees who had been stationed in Lebanese refugee camps. The group included families with school age children. Education is an important aspect of refugees’ adaptation process, as it is a key venue of mutual learning, both for the inhabitants of the receiving country and its prospective residents (Hannah, 2007). The purpose of this research is to improve education policies and practices relating to refugees by highlighting refugee students’ voices, as well as those of their parents and teachers. The main objectives involve assessing the experiences of the Syrian students and their parents and teachers at compulsory school level, by focusing on their personal perspectives, aspirations and challenges. By investigating the experiences and impressions of students, parents, teachers and others who participate in the study process, valuable information may be gathered for the purpose of facilitating this group’s adaptation and learning. This research was conducted with the participation of families residing outside the capital, in areas where only a small number of residents are of Arab origin. Refugees often arrive in groups in their host country and as a result become obvious minority groups, especially if they exhibit characteristics from their home country such as language and culture (Anderson, 2003). Various theories outline the adjustment process of refugees when moving to their host country, one of those being Berry’s (2005) theory of acculturation where he defines four adaptation approaches linked to two main premises; on the one hand, how strongly people prioritise the preservation of their cultural customs and self-image and, on the other, their readiness to participate in the larger community together with other social groups. Regarding the refugees’ (the minority group), adjustment is considered to occur when individuals no longer emphasise the conservation of their cultural self-image but prefer daily relationships within the host country’s cultural environment. Separation, however, takes place when individuals hold on to their own customs and traditions, avoiding participation in another culture (Berry, 2005). In the latter instance the person concerned does not adopt the dominant language or values of the host country, but preserves his/her own cultural traits (Anderson, 2003). Integration occurs when there is a wish to preserve own culture and at the same time participate in everyday contacts with other groups. Integration is regarded as the option that carries the strongest positive results. The least desirable outcome is marginalisation when there is but little interest in own cultural customs (for various reasons, for example “enforced cultural loss”) as well as reluctance to socialise with other groups (for reasons such as exclusion and discrimination) (Berry, 2005). Recent research by Eva Harðardottir and Berglind Ros Magnusdottir (2018) on mainstream trends and policies regarding young refugees in Icelandic primary and secondary schools indicated that the concept of adaptation focuses, first and foremost, on measures to help refugees adapt to Icelandic conditions and society, without assuming any mutual adjustment of Icelandic society. This focus is in the spirit of assimilation. The conclusions of their research also suggest that the comprehension of diversity is of a somewhat rigid and uniform nature, defining and separating groups on the basis of religion, culture or nationality. This distinction between separate cultures was found, for example, in research interviews with teachers. Three Syrian families, consisting of three fathers, three mothers and six children, volunteered to participate on the basis of the following criteria: (1) are classified as quota refugees, (2) live outside the capital area, and (3) have at least one child registered in an Icelandic primary school. Semi-structured interviews (Fife, 2005) were carried out with parents, students and five teachers – four female and one male – in the spring of 2018. Individual interviews were conducted with parents and teachers and group interviews with students. All interviews lasted 30-60 minutes and were sound-recorded upon agreement by participants. After each interview the recording was transcribed verbatim in English. Interviews in Arabic with parents and students were translated into English. The interviews were construed in accordance with the principles of thematic analysis and the data processed by means of descriptive content analysis (Vaismoradi et al., 2013). The results indicate that cultural values have affected the education process and the relationship between home and school. As a consequence parents did not fully trust the Icelandic schools their children attended. It was also found that teachers lacked the appropriate support and training to get to grips with this particular group of students. Nevertheless, the students themselves state that they are happy at school and have a positive relationship with their teachers.","[{'authorId': '2085056370', 'name': 'Hermína Gunnþórsdóttir'}, {'authorId': '2126034507', 'name': 'Kheirie El Hariri'}, {'authorId': '2094817310', 'name': 'Markus Meckl'}]",10.24270/netla.2020.8,2020,

16,219736080,189,The Borders around Us: Forced Migration and the Politics of Border Control,"Over the last decades, the global flow of international migrants has grown dramatically. In 2019, the number of migrants peaked at 271.6 million, an increase of 50.7 million since 2010 and of 97.8 million since 2000. Although Europe and North America were the most favored destinations for the majority of migrants in the 20th century, the destinations for international migrants have significantly diversified in the first two decades of the 21st century, with high numbers of migrants settling in every region of the world. To illustrate this global movement, Figure 1 provides an overview of migration trends by region of destination. Although northern America and Europe continue to receive a majority of migrants, their collective share has decreased from 56 percent in 2000 to 52 percent in 2019 (or 141 million migrants). Over the same period, northern Africa and western Asia reported the most significant increase. The number of migrants arriving in these regions more than doubled from 20.3 million in 2000 to 48.6 million in 2019, making these two regions the next largest migrant destinations behind North America and Europe. While northern African countries such as Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia were major sending sources of immigrants to Europe, this trend has been reversed as countries in western Asia and northern Europe have received significant numbers of unauthorizedmigrants,1 including Syrian refugees. In 2018, Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan together hosted 5.2 million Syrian refugees or 77 percent of the Syrian refugee population around the world (Todd 2019). Among international migrants, many left as a result of forced migration (UNHCR 2019). In 2019, an unprecedented 70.8 million people escaped their hometowns, often fleeing for their lives. This population consists of 41.3 million internally displaced people, 25.9 million refugees, and 3.5 million asylum seekers (UNHCR 2020). The majority were forced to leave due to wars and local conflicts, climate change, and natural disasters, or a “well-founded fear of persecution” on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political views (UN General Assembly 1951). In light of these trends, this article addresses two related questions. First, which border policies do many countries in the global North adopt to cope with refugees? Second, which policies can facilitate refugee integration and self-sufficiency? According to the UNHCR (2020), about 37,000 people uproot their lives every day. This is the equivalent of one person every 2 seconds leaving his or her home with little hope of an eventual return and with few possessions but the clothes on their backs.

17,253124810,189,Forced Displacement Literature Review,"Between August and October 2017 close to 700,000 ethnic minority Rohingyas fled Myanmar and sought refuge in Bangladesh. The authors use this event as a natural experiment to examine the impact of the influx of Rohingyas on food prices in Ukhia sub-district, the main host region in Bangladesh . 80 percent of the refugees settled in Ukhia sub-district, where the population increased by 300 percent due to the arrival of the refugees. The Rohingya do not have freedom of movement or the formal right to work, although some refugees work informally. The authors analyze 49 food items, looking at their prices 8-12 months before and after the arrival of refugees in the host region, and compare these price movements to those in other similar regions in Bangladesh. The analysis is based on price data collected from sub-district local government offices. The authors conclude that the sudden arrival of large numbers of refugees increased food prices in Ukhia sub-district . Even though food aid mitigated price increases for some food items (low-quality rice and soybeans), there would have been a detrimental impact on the welfare of host communities, at least in the short run. The authors anticipate that decreases in agricultural wages will be reflected in food prices in the long-run. This article examines the effect of inflows of internally displaced persons (IDPs) on food security in host communities in Nigeria. It also examines the differential impacts of displacement due to conflicts, natural disasters and communal clashes on food security in host communities. Food security outcomes are measured using the Food Consumption Score, which is a composite measure of dietary diversity, originally developed by the World Food Program. The analysis is based on the food consumption module of the General Household Survey (GHS) from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, together with survey data on IDPs from IOM. to respond to insurgency-driven displacement, compared to other types of forced displacement crises. In particular, security challenges create additional impediments to accessing communities. The authors advocate for greater preparedness for insurgency-based displacement, including through anticipatory early warning systems, more rapid needs assessment, budgetary provisions for response agencies ahead of the displacements, and more understanding of the demographics of displaced populations. This paper examines the different determinants of internal and external displacement . The author argues that people flee their homes when the expected utility of leaving exceeds the expected utility of staying, and that in general external displacement is costlier than internal displacement, due to additional risks to personal safety and increased financial hardships associated with crossing a border and adapting to life in a new country. However, when violence is perpetrated by government or there is widespread insurgent violence across the country, the risks of staying and the benefits of fleeing the country are high, and people are more likely to flee across borders. The analysis is based on refugee and IDPs flows between 1989 and 2017 from UNHCR and data on conflict from the Armed Conflict Dataset from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program/Peace Research Institute in Oslo (UCDP/PRIO). The author also controls for political, economic and geographic factors, drawing on data from the World Bank (level of economic development), Polity IV dataset (regime type) and Transborder Ethnic Kin Dataset (ethnic relations between origin and destination country). The author finds that the pattern of displacement depends on: (1) the perpetrator; and (2) the geographical spread of the violence. Specific findings are as follows: different abroad , differentiating between: (a) indirect violence (such as shelling or shooting), which is less likely to target specific individuals but occurs due to proximity to a battlefield; and (b) direct violence (including physical assaults, torture, sexual violence, abductions, forced labor, and wage theft), which specifically targets individuals. Following Schewel (2019), the frame the analysis in terms of an individual’s motivation to migrate (aspiration) that may be impeded by their capacity to migrate (capability). The analysis is based on a novel dataset that includes: (a) demographic data, arrival and return dates (if applicable) for two million Syrian refugees from UNHCR’s Profile Global Registration System (ProGres) database; (b) data on living conditions in Jordan and Lebanon from vulnerability surveys conducted by UN agencies; and (c) conditions in Syria from a conflict-events database and nightlights data for Syria This paper estimates the causal effect of inflow Syrian refugees on crime rates in Turkey . By the end of 2020, the number of Syrian refugees in Turkey had reached 3.6 million, almost all of whom live outside of refugee camps in host communities. The authors examine variations in refugee numbers and crime rates per 100,000 inhabitants (including natives and refugees) across Turkish provinces and over time for the period 2008-2019. The analysis is disaggregated by category of crime, including: assault, crimes involving firearms and knives, homicide, robbery, smuggling, theft, sexual crimes, kidnapping, defamation, use and purchase of drugs, and production and commerce of drugs. The analysis is based on provincial crime data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) together with several additional province-level datasets. informal sector, displacing low-skilled Turkish workers who may consequently resort to illegal activities. The authors offer several possible explanations for this counter-intuitive result: (i) the threat of detention or refoulement may deter refugees from crime; (ii) employment of refugees in the informal sector and cash assistance programs may provide adequate income, eliminating the necessity to resort to illegal activities; and (iii) many Turkish natives displaced from the formal labor market found employment and increased wages in the expanding formal labor market. This article examines the impact of including refugee children in government schools on learning achievement of both refugee and native pupils in the West Nile region of Uganda . Between June 2016 and December 2017, the refugee population in Uganda increased from 0.2 million to 1.4 million, largely due to the arrival of large numbers of refugees from South Sudan. As of October 2017, when data for this study was collected, there were more than 1 million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, the majority hosted in the West Nile region. Humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations established donor-funded schools in the refugee settlements when there weren’t any nearby government schools. Government schools also donor assistance proportionate to the number of refugees they enrolled. The analysis draws on household survey data collected from South Sudanese refugees and host communities, including learning assessments. During the survey, a questionnaire was administered to household heads (or their representatives) to collect information on the households and children aged 16 and younger. English and mathematics tests were administered to all children aged 6 to 16, regardless of their school attendance. This article examines the causal effect of refugees resettled in the United State (US) on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows from the US to refugees’ countries of origin, and studies the case of Vietnamese ‘boat people’ who arrived in the US in 1975. Specifically, the authors examine the effect of refugees who entered the US between 1990 and 2000 on FDI to their countries of origin between 2005 and 2015. For the case of Vietnamese boat people, the authors examine the effect of country policies and refugees’ human capital in influencing FDI from the US to Vietnam. The analysis is based on confidential data on the universe of refugees resettled in the US between 1990 and 2015 from the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) of the US Department of State, together with project-level FDI data from fDiMarkets, a research arm of the Financial Times Group (FT). The authors conclude that refugees foster FDI to their origin countries approximately a generation after they were first resettled, and this effect is larger when peace and political stability prevail in origin countries . These findings demonstrate the strong ties that refugees maintain with their origin countries years or even decades after their displacement. This article provides a systematic review of 12 studies published between 2008 and 2018 on self-harming behavior among refugees and asylum-seekers in Europe . Self-harming behavior is defined as the deliberate and self-inflicted damage of body tissue (such as cutting, burning, scratching the skin or hitting) without suicidal intent and for purposes not socially or culturally sanctioned. Most of the articles included in the review investigated refugees’ mental health broadly, including some self-harm episodes. The lack of specific research on self-harming behavior among refugees and asylum-seekers might be due to difficulties accessing this population, or because the scientific community is reluctant to recognize self-harm as an independent clinical condition, and tend to associate it with other syndromes.","[{'authorId': '2140164897', 'name': 'A.
